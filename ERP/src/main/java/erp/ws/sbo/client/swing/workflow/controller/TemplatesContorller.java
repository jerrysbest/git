 *  @version 1.0
 *  most  of the function of approval procedures which would be used to approve documents in sap now is 
 *  coding by us ,of course,we will still use some tables in sap.
 *  
 *  In sbo,these are many shortage in approval procedures.For instance,originators must be a user in sap,if you want to set 
 *  it sales,sales of district,and so so,the system can't support.As the same in approval stage,you can only set the authorizer as a user,and can't set it originator's 
 *  manager.Then,can't we make it more flexible  in order to satisfy  the needs of different kinds of business procedure.
